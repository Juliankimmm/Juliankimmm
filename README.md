# Hi there, I'm Julian Kim! 👋

I am a student-athlete at Case Western Reserve University, passionate about software engineering and creating solutions that make people's lives easier.

## 🚀 Projects

Here are some of the projects I'm currently working on:

### Project 1: PDF Project 

The PDF Toolkit is a user-friendly web application born out of the specific needs of a law office. What began as a simple PDF merge tool has transformed into a versatile toolkit, offering features such as merging multiple PDFs, extracting specific pages, switching page positions, and moving pages within a document. With a drag-and-drop interface and straightforward buttons, this toolkit empowers users to effortlessly manage and manipulate PDFs, making it an invaluable asset for anyone dealing with document organization and customization. Dive into the world of seamless PDF handling with the PDF Toolkit! 📄✨
