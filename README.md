# Hi there, I'm Julian Kim! 👋

I am a student-athlete at Case Western Reserve University, passionate about software engineering and artificial intelligence. The goal is to create solutions that make people's lives easier or just a little bit more enjoyable.

## 🚀 Projects

Here are some of the projects worth checking out:

### Project 1: Neural Network-Based Iris Classification Model

A fully connected feedforward neural network designed to classify Iris species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on their features. The model uses dimensionality reduction via PCA for visualization and features ReLU activations for non-linear learning. It is trained with categorical cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer, achieving high accuracy on the Iris dataset.
